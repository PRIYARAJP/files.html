    <hr><H1>QN1-1.Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators. in js</H1>
<pre>
    ==
    equal value every data types mean any data type eg string="5",number=5; "5"==="5" true---5===5 true---5==="5"true
    == is used to compare two variables irrespective of the variable's data type.
    ===
    equal value equal data types mean same data type eg string="5",number=5; "5"==="5" true---5===5 true---5==="5"false
    === is used to compare two variables, but this will check strict type, which means it will check the datatype and compare two values.
    0 == false // true
    0 === false // false, because they are of a different type
    1 == "1" // true, automatic type conversion for value only
    1 === "1" // false, because they are of a different type
    null == undefined // true
    null === undefined // false
    '0' == false // true
    '0' === false // false</pre>

    <hr><H1>4.What is execution context</h1>
    <pre>
        There are two kinds of Execution Context in JavaScript:

Global Execution Context (GEC)
Function Execution Context (FEC)

Global Execution Context (GEC)
Whenever the JavaScript engine receives a script file, it first creates
 a default Execution Context known as the Global Execution Context (GEC).

The GEC is the base/default Execution Context where all JavaScript
 code that is not inside of a function gets executed.

For every JavaScript file, there can only be one GEC.
Function Execution Context (FEC)
Whenever a function is called, the JavaScript engine creates a
 different type of Execution Context known as a Function Execution
  Context (FEC) within the GEC to evaluate and execute the code within that function.

Since every function call gets its own FEC, there can be more than one FEC in the run-time of a script.


Global Execution Context (GEC)

        function b(){

        }
        
        function a(){
            b();
        }
        
        a();
        Now first of all Global Execution Context is going to be created (as explained above)
        
        then execution starts and interpreeter encounters call to function
        a(), and here a new execution context is created pushed on top EC
        Stack
        
        so anytime you invoke a function a new EC is created & placed on top of EC Stack.
        
        so now EC for a() is CREATED interpreeter will execute the code inside a() line-by-line
        
        then intrepreeter encounters call to function b(), this creates another EC which is pushed on top or EC stack
        
        When b() finishes it will be popped-off the stack then a() will finish & all the way down to Global EC
   
        Function Execution Context (FEC)
        function foo() {
            alert(this);
        }
        
        foo() // window
        new foo() // foo

        this IS IMP IN Function Execution Context (FEC)

        let x = 10;

        function timesTen(a){
            return a * 10;
        }

        let y = timesTen(x);//output//100 

        console.log(y);

        First, declare the x variable and initialize its value with 10.
        Second, declare the timesTen() function that accepts an argument and returns a value that is the
         result of multiplication of the argument with 10.
        Third, call the timesTen() function with the argument as the value of the x variable and store result in the variable y.
        Finally, output the variable y to the Console.

        2.execution phase?
        In this phase, JS executes our code line by line and assigns the value to the
         variables. In our example above, the value 10 to the variable a is set.
        function foo() {
            console.log("function foo is called!")
          }
          foo()
          console.log(a);
          var a = 10;
          console.log(a)
          //output
          function foo is called!
            undefined

    <PRE>
        First-Class Function: A programming language is said to have First-class functions if functions in that
         language are treated like other variables. So the functions can be assigned to any other variable or
          passed as an argument or can be returned by another function. JavaScript treat function as a first-class-citizens. 
          This means that functions are simply a value and are just another type of object.
          
          const Arithmetics = {
            add: (a, b) => {
                return `${a} + ${b} = ${a + b}`;
            },
            subtract: (a, b) => {
                return `${a} - ${b} = ${a - b}`
            },
            multiply: (a, b) => {
                return `${a} * ${b} = ${a * b}`
            },
            division: (a, b) => {
                if (b != 0) return `${a} / ${b} = ${a / b}`;
                return `Cannot Divide by Zero!!!`;
            }
      
        }
      //100 is treated as a thats a First-Class Function mean variable treating
        document.write(Arithmetics.add(100, 100) + "<br>");

    <PRE>
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/JS/js_function_call.asp"></a>
        The call() method calls the function directly and sets this to the first argument passed to the 
        call method and if any other sequences of arguments preceding the first argument are passed 
        to the call method then they are passed as an argument to the function.
       
        example
        let nameObj = {
            name: "Tony"
        }
          
        let PrintName = {
            name: "steve",
            sayHi: function (age) {
                console.log(this.name + " age is " + age);
            }
        }
          
        PrintName.sayHi.call(nameObj, 42);//Tony age is 42
        PrintName.sayHi.call(PrintName,42);//steve age is 42

        Apply() Method: The apply() method calls the function directly and sets
         this to the first argument passed to the apply method and if any other 
         arguments provided as an array are passed to the call method then they are passed as an argument to the function.

        let nameObj = {
            name: "Tony"
        }
        
        let PrintName = {
            name: "steve",
            sayHi: function (...age) {
                console.log(this.name + " age is " + age);
            }
        }
        PrintName.sayHi.apply(nameObj, [42]);//Tony age is 42
        PrintName.sayHi.apply(PrintName, [42]);//steve age is 42

        Bind() Method: The bind() method creates a new function and when that new function is called it set this keyword 
        to the first argument which is passed to the bind method, and if any other sequences of arguments preceding the first 
        argument are passed to the bind method then they are passed as an argument to the new function when the new function is called.
        
        let nameObj = {
            name: "Tony"
        }
          
        let PrintName = {
            name: "steve",
            sayHi: function () {
          
                // Here "this" points to nameObj
                console.log(this.name); 
            }
        }

    <hr><H1>9.What are objects in javascript?</H1>
    <PRE>
        Objects, in JavaScript, are the most important data type and form the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
         These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data types (Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined, and symbol) 
         in the sense that these primitive data types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
        const person = {
            firstName: "John",
            lastName: "Doe",
            age: 50,
            eyeColor: "blue"
          };
          
          // Display some data from the object:
          document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
          person.firstName + " is " + person.age + " years old.";

    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/Function">fun</a>
    <pre>
    The Function() constructor creates Function objects. Calling the constructor directly can create functions
     dynamically, but suffers from security and similar (but far less significant) performance issues as eval(). However, 
    unlike eval (which may have access to the local scope), the Function constructor creates 
    functions which execute in the global scope only.
    
    const sum = new Function('a', 'b', 'return a + b');
    console.log(sum(2, 6));
    // Expected output: 8
</pre>
   
    <hr><H1>11.Explain prototypes</H1>
    <PRE>
    Prototype property is basically an object (also known as Prototype object), where we can attach methods and
     properties in a prototype object, which enables all the other objects to inherit these methods and properties.
    
     // function constructor
    function Person(name, job, yearOfBirth){
    this.name= name;
    this.job= job;
    this.yearOfBirth= yearOfBirth;
    }
    // this will show Person's prototype property
    console.log(Person.prototype);

    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/JS/js_object_prototypes.asp">w3</a>
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes">mozilla</a>
    Prototype Inheritance
    All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype:

    Date objects inherit from Date.prototype
    Array objects inherit from Array.prototype
    Person objects inherit from Person.prototype
    The Object.prototype is on the top of the prototype inheritance chain:

    Date objects, Array objects, and Person objects inherit from Object.prototype.

        <hr><H1>12.What is prototype chain</H1>
    <PRE>
        prototype chain it mean calling function inside the object so it is chin property
        const myObject = {
            city: "Madrid",
            greet() {
              console.log(`Greetings from ${this.city}`);

    <hr><H1>13.Give an example of inheritance using function constructor</H1>
    <PRE>
        Define inheritance using function constructor?

        Using the constructor function, we can create a new object after passing the required parameters. 
        Inheriting a previously defined constructor function means using the parameters of the previously 
        defined function along with adding some new parameters to the newly defined constructor function. 
        
        example
        function Employee(name, age, gender, id) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
            this.gender = gender;
            this.id = id;
        };
          
        function Developer(name, age, gender, id, specialization) {
          
            // Calling Employee constructor function
            Employee.call(this, name, age, gender, id);
          
            // Adding a new parameter
            this.specialization = specialization;
        }
          
        // Creating objects
        let Employee1 = new Employee("Suraj", 28, "Male", 564);
        let Developer1 = new Developer("Karishma", 31, "Female", 345,
            "Frontend Developer");
        console.log(Employee1);
        console.log(Developer1);

    </PRE>
    
    <hr><H1>
   14.What are callbacks?
    </H1>
    <PRE>A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.

        Using a callback, you could call the calculator function (myCalculator) 
        with a callback (myCallback), and let the calculator function run the callback after
         the calculation is finished:

        function myDisplayer(something) {
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = something;
          }
          
          function myCalculator(num1, num2, myCallback) {
            let sum = num1 + num2;
            myCallback(sum);
          }
          
          myCalculator(5, 5, myDisplayer);

In the example above, myDisplayer is a called a callback function.

It is passed to myCalculator() as an argument.

When you pass a function as an argument, remember not to use parenthesis.

Right: myCalculator(5, 5, myDisplayer);

Wrong: myCalculator(5, 5, myDisplayer());

    <hr><H1>15.What is the use of setTimeout?
    </H1>
    <PRE>
        IT IS USED TO FIX TIME TO MAKE CHANGE AUTOMATICALLY


        The setTimeout() method calls a function after a number of milliseconds.

        1 second = 1000 milliseconds.

        Notes
        The setTimeout() is executed only once.

        If you need repeated executions, use setInterval() instead.

        Use the clearTimeout() method to prevent the function from starting.

        To clear a timeout, use the id returned from setTimeout():

        myTimeout = setTimeout(function, milliseconds);

        EG

        function sayHi() {
            alert('Hello');
          }
          
          setTimeout(sayHi, 1000);
(OR)

function startTime() {
    const date = new Date();
    document.getElementById("txt").innerHTML = date.toLocaleTimeString();
    setTimeout(function() {startTime()}, 1000);
  }

    <PRE>
        <B>event loop</B>
        JavaScript is a single-threaded synchronous programming language. 
        But what does it actually mean? What is this event loop in JavaScript 
        that we all keep talking about? 

        What does it actually mean when we say JavaScript is single threaded?

        It means that the main thread where JavaScript code is run, runs in one line

        <B>call stack</B>
        The call stack is used by JavaScript to keep track of multiple function calls.
         It is like a real stack in data structures where data can be pushed and popped and 
         follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. We use call stack for memorizing 
         which function is running right now. 

        Example: The below example demonstrates the call stack.

        
    function f1() {
        console.log('Hi by f1!');
      }
        
      function f2() {
        f1();
        console.log('Hi by f2!');
      }
        
      f2();

        "Hi by f1!"
        "Hi by f2!"

    <PRE></PRE>
    <i>Promises allow errors to be passed down the chain and handled in one common place without having to put in layers of manual error handling.</i>
    A JavaScript Promise object contains both the producing code and calls to the consuming code:
        Promise Object Properties
    A JavaScript Promise object can be:

    Pending
    Fulfilled
    Rejected
    The Promise object supports two properties: state and result.

    While a Promise object is "pending" (working), the result is undefined.

    When a Promise object is "fulfilled", the result is a value.

    When a Promise object is "rejected", the result is an error object.
    function myDisplayer(some) {
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = some;
      }
      
      let myPromise = new Promise(function(myResolve, myReject) {
        let x = 1;
      
      // some code (try to change x to 5)
      
        if (x == 0) {
          myResolve("OK");
        } else {
          myReject("Error");
        }
      });
      
      myPromise.then(
        function(value) {myDisplayer(value);},
        function(error) {myDisplayer(error);}
      );
    <hr><H1>18.what is the purpose of async/await keywords?</H1>
    <PRE>
        The async and await keywords in JavaScript are used for working with asynchronous code in a synchronous-like
         manner. The async keyword is used to declare a function as asynchronous, which means that it will
          return a promise. Inside an async function, 
        the await keyword can be used to pause the execution of the function until a promise is resolved.
        The keyword async before a function makes the function return a promise:
        async function myFunction() {return "Hello";}

        myFunction().then(
        function(value) {myDisplayer(value);},
        function(error) {myDisplayer(error);}
        );
        The await keyword can only be used inside an async function.

        The await keyword makes the function pause the execution and wait for a resolved promise before it continues:
        async function myDisplay() {
            let myPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
              resolve("I love myself !!");
            });
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = await myPromise;
          }
          
          myDisplay();
    </PRE>
    <hr><H1>19.What is hoisting?</H1>
    <PRE>
        Hoisting is a concept that enables us to extract values of variables and functions even before 
        initializing/assigning value without getting errors and this is happening due to the 1st phase
         (memory creation phase) of the Execution Context.


        Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.
        JavaScript Declarations are Hoisted
        In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.
        
        In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.
        only var is used in Hoisting 
        hosting
        {
        var x; // Declare x//hosting x
        x = 5; // Assign 5 to x

        elem = document.getElementById("demo"); // Find an element 
        elem.innerHTML = x;           // Display x in the element

        }

        not hosting
        {
        var x = 5; // Declare x//not hosting x // Assign 5 to x

        elem = document.getElementById("demo"); // Find an element

        DOM (Document Object Model)
        The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.

The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:

"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."

The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:

Core DOM - standard model for all document types
XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents

21.Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN
</H1>
<PRE>
undefined
It works like when we declared a variable in the code but did not assign the value before printing the variable value
console.log(a);//undefined
var a = 5;
console.log(a);
//OUTPUT
undefined
5


not defined
It works like when we did not declare the variable and try to call that variable.
console.log(a);//undefined
  var a = 5;
  console.log(a);
  console.log(b);//not defined
  //OUTPUT
  undefined
  5
  not defined

  NaN (Not a Number)
  It represents a value that is not a valid number. It can be used 
  to check whether a number entered is a valid number or not a number.
   To assign a variable to NaN value, we can use one of the two following ways.
  console.log("hi"/5)//NaN
  console.log("hi"+5)//"hi5"
  console.log("hi"-5)//NaN

    f??t=f
    t??f =t
    t??null or undefined =t
    null or undefined??t=t
    Otherwise it returns the second.
    {
        let name = "hii";
    let text = "missing";
    let result = name ?? text;
    console.log(result)//hii

    <hr><H1>24.What are pure functions?</H1>
    <PRE>
        A Pure Function is a function (a block of code) that always returns the same result if
         the same arguments are passed. It does not depend on any state or data change during a program’s 
         execution. Rather, it only depends on its input arguments.

        Also, a pure function does not produce any observable side effects such as network requests or data mutation, etc.

    Let’s see the below JavaScript Function:

    function calculateGST( productPrice ) {
        return productPrice * 0.05;
        }
        console.log(calculateGST(15))
        //output
        0.75

        The above function will always return the same result if we pass the same product price. In other words, its output doesn’t 
        get affected by any other values/state changes. So we can call the “calculate GST” function a Pure Function.

        Callback Hell: Callback Hell is essentially nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid

    <PRE>
        Promise Chaining: Promise Chaining is a simple concept by which we may initialize another promise inside our .
        then() method and accordingly we may execute our results. The function inside then captures the value returned
         by the previous promise 

        The syntax for using promise chaining is as follows.
        let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            resolve("Hello JavaScript");
            });
             
            promise
            .then( function (result1){
                console.log(result1);
                return new Promise((resolve,reject) =>{
                    resolve("GFG is awesome");
                })
            })
            .then((result2) => {
                console.log(result2);
            });

        Before Arrow:
        hello = function() {
        return "Hello World!";
        }

        With Arrow Function:
        hello = () => {
        return "Hello World!";

        );
        The await keyword can only be used inside an async function.

        The await keyword makes the function pause the execution and wait for a resolved promise before it continues:

    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_scope.asp">scope</a>
    <PRE>
        Block Scope
        let and const. is block scope
        These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.

Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:
{
    let x = 2;
  }
  // x can NOT be used here



  Local Scope
Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.
// code here can NOT use carName

function myFunction() {
  let carName = "Volvo";
  // code here CAN use carName
}

// code here can NOT use carName

Function Scope
JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.

Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.

Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared inside a function.

They all have Function Scope:

function myFunction() {
  var carName = "Volvo";   // Function Scope
}


Scope Chain:

JavaScript engine uses scopes to find out the exact location or accessibility of variables and that particular
 process is known as Scope Chain.
Scope Chain means that one variable has a scope (it may be global or local/function or block scope) is used 
by another variable or function having another scope (may be global or local/function or block scope).
This complete chain formation goes on and stops when the user wishes to stop it according to the requirement.

var global_variable = 20;
  
    function main_function() {
        // Local Variable
        var local_variable = 30;
  
        var nested_function = function () {
  
            // Display the value inside the local variable
            console.log(local_variable);
        }
  
        var another_nested_function = function () {
              
            // Displays the value inside the global variable
            console.log(global_variable);
        }
  
        nested_function();
        another_nested_function();
    }

        Null: It is the intentional absence of the value. It is one of the primitive values of JavaScript.
        Null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value. 
        It is a Primitive value in Javascript

        Undefined: It means the value does not exist in the compiler. It is the global object.
        Undefined means a variable has been declared but has yet not been assigned a value.
        It is an ECMAScript1 (ES1) feature.
        It is a global property.

        map

        A Map holds key-value pairs where the keys can be any datatype.
        A Map remembers the original insertion order of the keys.
        
        let num =[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];
        let ev = num.map((val)=>{ return val;});
        console.log(num);//[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
        console.log(ev);//[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

        let people =[
      {id : 1, fname : "josan",lname :"sanjay"},
      {id : 2, fname : "riya",lname :"raj"},
      {id : 1, fname : "mithra",lname :"bindhu"},
]


FILTER

The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function.

The filter() method does not execute the function for empty elements.

The filter() method does not change the original array.

let fulln =  people.map((val)=>{
      return val.fname+val.lname
})
console.log(fulln);//output//[ 'josansanjay', 'riyaraj', 'mithrabindhu' ]


EVEN
let age =[16,17,24,56,44];
let adult = age.filter((value)=>{
      return value >=18;
});
      console.log("adult",adult);//OUTPUT//adult (3) [24, 56, 44]


let n=[1,2,3,4,5];
let even =n.filter((value)=>{
      return value % 2 ==0;
})
let o =n.filter((value)=>{
      return value % 2 ==1;

    <hr><H1>35.Explain passed by value and passed by reference</H1>
    <PRE>
        Pass By Value: In Pass by value, function is called by directly passing the value of the variable as an argument.
         So any changes made inside the function does not affect the original value.

        In Pass by value, parameters passed as an arguments create its own copy. So any changes made inside the function is 
        made to the copied value not to the original value .

        function Passbyvalue(a, b) {
            let tmp;
            tmp = b;
            b = a;
            a = tmp;
            console.log(`Inside Pass by value
                function -> a = ${a} b = ${b}`);
        }
         
        let a = 1;
        let b = 2;
        console.log(`Before calling Pass by value
                Function -> a = ${a} b = ${b}`);
         
        Passbyvalue(a, b);
         
        console.log(`After calling Pass by value
               Function -> a =${a} b = ${b}`);

               Output:

        Before calling Pass by value Function -> a = 1 b = 2
        Inside Pass by value function -> a = 2 b = 1
        After calling Pass by value Function -> a =1 b = 2


        Pass by Reference: In Pass by Reference, Function is called by directly passing the reference/address of
         the variable as an argument. So changing the value inside the function also change the original value. 
         In JavaScript array and Object follows pass by reference property.

        In Pass by reference, parameters passed as an arguments does not create its own copy, it refers to the 
        original value so changes made inside function affect the original value. 

        function PassbyReference(obj) {
            let tmp = obj.a;
            obj.a = obj.b;
            obj.b = tmp;
         
            console.log(`Inside Pass By Reference
                Function -> a = ${obj.a} b = ${obj.b}`);
        }
         
        let obj = {
            a: 10,
            b: 20
         
        }
        console.log(`Before calling Pass By Reference
            Function -> a = ${obj.a} b = ${obj.b}`);
         
        PassbyReference(obj)
         
        console.log(`After calling Pass By Reference
            Function -> a = ${obj.a} b = ${obj.b}`);

    <hr><H1>36.Please explain Self Invoking Function and its code</H1>
    <PRE>
        Function expressions can be made "self-invoking".

        A self-invoking expression is invoked (started) automatically, without being called.

        Function expressions will execute automatically if the expression is followed by ().

        You cannot self-invoke a function declaration.

        You have to add parentheses around the function to indicate that it is a function expression:

        Example
        (function () {
        let x = "Hello!!";  // I will invoke myself
        })();
